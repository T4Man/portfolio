    body: "I've been working in the IT field since 1998. Most of my experience had been in Microsoft Windows Enterprise environments providing end user technical support along with some networking and IT project support. In 2015 I decided to take my career in a new direction by enrolling at Code Fellows in Seattle. I'm currently in the Code 301 class and planning to continue on to the Code 401 Full-Stack Javascript class. I've learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with tools such as jQuery, AJAX, JSON and SQL. Concepts learned include, DOM manipulation, mobile-first responsive design, SMACSS, templating, and object-oriented and functional programming."
