After considerable contemplation I decided my initial concept would not meet the
course requirements. I elected to start a new design and redo the entire thing.
I borrowed from the class Blog project for the base design and have modified it considerably.

Class-06 changes reflect addition of AJAX functionality for populating the Projects
database and dynamically updating the page whenever new data is added.

Class-07 changes reflect refactoring of the 'load' method from a $.each() to a
map method, wrapping interface methods in an IIFE and correcting some indentation
and spacing in the code. Also learned the importance of clearing the local storage
when engaging in troubleshooting!!

Class-08 styling

Class-09 changes reflect refactoring the object constructor to handle dynamic input, and a minor
change of an argument abbreviation. The 'populate' methods could likely be refactored into a single instance. This would need to coincide with refactoring the 'fetch' method. My understanding
from a conversation with Brian is that I could use client-side routing to accomplish this. We will be learning about this during Class 11.

Class-11 changes reflect the use of page.js to create a SPA. The project and about information are being handled by routes.js, mainController.js and aboutController.js files. I played around a little with Node and Express but will wait until later this week to implement them. I did not include my tabs for my personal website because of the shear size of trying to import that into a SPA. It made more sense to keep it an external link. I understand we will be working with Git Hub tokens later in the week so I'll include the Git Hub tab at that time.
