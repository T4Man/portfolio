After considerable contemplation I decided my initial concept would not meet the
course requirements. I elected to start a new design and redo the entire thing.
I borrowed from the class Blog project for the base design and have modified it considerably.

Class-06 changes reflect addition of AJAX functionality for populating the Projects
database and dynamically updating the page whenever new data is added.
